      "CLAIM:  Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?\n",
      "VERDICT:  0 wahrscheinlich\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  International studies suggest that the number of corona infections decreases when many people wear masks - whether fabric, surgical or FFP2 masks. However, it is not possible to precisely quantify how great the protective effect actually is. It probably depends on the type of masks and the proportion of people who wear them.\n",

      "CLAIM:  Can homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus help against dizziness?\n",
      "VERDICT:  1 wissenschafliche Beweise fehlen\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  We have found only one study that has investigated this. However, it is so poor that no reliable statement is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLAIM:  Can zeolite alleviate or prevent health problems?\n",
      "VERDICT:  1 wissenschafliche Beweise fehlen\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  Studies to date cannot provide any evidence that taking zeolite prevents or alleviates complaints. A detoxifying effect is not scientifically plausible.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLAIM:  Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?\n",
      "VERDICT:  0 ja\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  In a large, well-done study, paxlovid prevented hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. They were unvaccinated and had contracted the delta variant. For vaccinated people, the benefit cannot be reliably estimated. This also applies to people with immunodeficiency.\n",

      "CLAIM:  Does starting school later improve health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents?\n",
      "VERDICT:  1 wissenschafliche Beweise fehlen\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  The question has been investigated in several large studies. Due to methodological deficiencies and contradictory results, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This means that science can currently neither speak for nor against a benefit of a later school start.\n",

      "CLAIM:  Does the F.X. Mayr cure have health benefits? Can it prevent diseases or treat them?\n",
      "VERDICT:  1 wissenschafliche Beweise fehlen\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  It is neither examined nor proven whether the special fasting method after F.X. Mayr holds, which it promises: Namely assistance with all possible illnesses of allergies, over rheumatism up to sleep disturbances. The advertised detoxification and \"purification\" of the body by the chamfering cure are besides scientifically not plausible.\n",

      "CLAIM:  Does the consumption of soy foods or soy isoflavones affect the appearance of acne skin?\n",

      "EXPLANATION:  We could not find any meaningful studies at all on the influence of soy foods on acne. On soy isoflavones, we found two small studies of questionable quality that examined a very specific group of sufferers. Soy isoflavones improved the skin appearance somewhat. However, this result is not reliable.\n",

      "EXPLANATION:  The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin.\n",

      "CLAIM:  Is the homeopathic remedy Neradin effective for erectile dysfunction?\n",

      "CLAIM:  Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?\n",
      "VERDICT:  0 wahrscheinlich ein bisschen\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  Regular examination of the cervix by means of PAP smear tests detects precancerous stages of the cervix in most cases in good time. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer. An additional HPV test every three to five years can make screening even more reliable. However, the difference should not be too great.\n",

      "VERDICT:  0 möglicherweise\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking.\n",

      "CLAIM:  Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?\n",
      "VERDICT:  1 wissenschafliche Beweise fehlen\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  Whether olive leaf extract lowers blood pressure has been investigated in five suitable studies to date. They all found no effect or only a slight effect of the extract. The problem with this is that most of the study participants had only slightly elevated blood pressure. They cannot answer how olive leaf extract works in people with significantly elevated blood pressure (hypertension). The studies also had gross flaws, few participants, and ran for a very short time. They cannot provide reliable answers.\n",

      "VERDICT:  1 wissenschafliche Beweise fehlen\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  The question was examined in four small studies with serious methodological deficiencies, which also arrived at partly contradictory results. No clear conclusions can be drawn from them. The claim that green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis is not scientifically proven.\n",

      "CLAIM:  Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?\n",
      "VERDICT:  0 möglicherweise ein bisschen\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  The summarized results of studies to date suggest that probiotics in capsule or tablet form could lower blood sugar somewhat. At least if they are taken over a period of two to three months. However, the effect is not well established. Probiotic dairy products and probiotic powder for dissolving do not seem to have any demonstrable effect.\n",

      "VERDICT:  0 wahrscheinlich\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  Even if breathing with a mask can feel uncomfortable: According to studies to date, you get just as much oxygen with an FFP2 mask or mouth-nose protection as without a mask. This is true even when you are moving or exerting yourself. Only very intensive sports slightly reduce the oxygen content in the blood - but too little to endanger health.\n",

      "VERDICT:  1 wissenschafliche Beweise fehlen\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  Whether CBD can relieve menstrual pain has apparently never been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. Women who suffer from severe period pain should talk to a gynecologist about it. Diseases such as endometriosis could be behind it.\n",

      "CLAIM:  Can a bioresonance device like \"Bioscan\" or \"Vieva Vital Analyser\" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?\n",
      "VERDICT:  2 nein\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  An experiment shows that the devices cannot distinguish between healthy people, seriously ill people and a corpse. The claimed mode of action behind the measurement method is also scientifically implausible. A German court has convicted the manufacturers of the Bioscan device (not legally binding) of fraud.\n",

      "VERDICT:  1 wissenschafliche Beweise fehlen\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  So far, studies seem to exist only on microimmunotherapy against hay fever and cancer. Their significance is far too low to conclude that the therapy is effective. We found no studies on other health problems. Thus, there is no proven benefit of microimmunotherapy for any disease.\n",

      "VERDICT:  1 wissenschafliche Beweise fehlen\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  Five small studies provide no overall evidence of benefit from green-lipped mussel in rheumatism. However, the rheumatism treatment of the participants does not meet today's standards and the studies were very poorly conducted. Therefore, we cannot draw any reliable conclusions from these studies.\n",

      "VERDICT:  1 wissenschafliche Beweise fehlen\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  A link between the long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills and the development of dementia cannot be ruled out. However, whether the drugs are the cause of dementia is unclear. Likewise, it is possible that studies show a connection only because people in the undiagnosed early stages of dementia suffer more frequently from sleep disorders or restlessness and therefore take medication against them more often.\n",

      "EXPLANATION:  A large observational study has found an increased risk of lung cancer with long-term use of ACE inhibitors compared with another group of antihypertensive drugs. However, other causes for this association cannot be completely ruled out. Previous studies have reached inconsistent results. Therefore, it can currently neither be confirmed nor ruled out that the risk of lung cancer may increase with ACE inhibitors. Even if further studies should really confirm the increased risk, the effect is likely to be rather small.\n",

      "EXPLANATION:  The analysis of 29 studies suggests that quarantine can prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths. The validity of the studies to date is diminished by the fact that only mathemathic modeling studies are available for coronavirus. However, observational studies and modeling of the related diseases SARS and MERS show much the same thing: precautionary quarantine of those who may be infected is likely to be effective, especially if the action is taken early. As a stand-alone measure, quarantine is unlikely to be sufficient to sustainably contain the pandemic.\n",

On the other hand, there are individual cases of bone cancer in people treated with teriparatide - although a causal relationship cannot be clearly proven here. Systematic studies of people treated with teriparatide could not provide clear results. Since bone cancer is a very rare disease, its risk factors are difficult to pin down in studies.\n",

      "EXPLANATION:  The efficacy of kinesiotaping in relation to non-specific chronic low back pain (\"low back pain\") has been investigated in only a few studies. Overall, the evidence suggests that pain intensity does not decrease with kinesiotapes any more than with a placebo tape; thus, the tapes may not be effective. However, this preliminary finding is not well supported. This is because the best studies currently available do not compare well, most lasted only four weeks, and had few subjects overall.\n",

      "CLAIM:  Does HPV vaccination reduce the risk of cervical cancer in girls?\n",
      "VERDICT:  0 wahrscheinlich Ja\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  HPV vaccination reduces the risk of abnormal tissue changes (of grade CIN2 and higher) on the cervix, which can later develop into cancer. Thus, the risk of later developing cervical cancer probably also decreases. However, the vaccination does not provide complete protection because it is not effective against all cancer-causing human papilloma viruses (HPV).\n",

      "VERDICT:  0 wahrscheinlich Ja\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  Intermittent fasting (also: intermittent fasting) is probably effective for losing weight. In terms of weight reduction, there are probably no clear differences from a conventional diet in which calories are permanently reduced. Both paths can lead to weight reductions that are significant for health. The current assessment is based mainly on studies over a maximum of 12 months with middle-aged women from affluent countries.

      "VERDICT:  0 wahrscheinlich Ja\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  The study evidence to date shows that perineal birth injuries are likely to be somewhat reduced in the group of women having a baby for the first time. This is due in particular to the fact that fewer perineal incisions were performed. The positive effect could not be shown for women who had already had a vaginal delivery.\n",

      "EXPLANATION:  The first indications of a possible link between the consumption of industrially produced, highly processed products and cancer have emerged in a large French observational study. So it could be that people who eat and drink more highly processed products (e.g., convenience foods) are somewhat more likely to develop cancer. More long-term research on this important topic is definitely needed. Current knowledge is by no means well established, and reliable evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship between highly processed food and cancer is lacking.

      "EXPLANATION:  Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to be helpful in more severe depression, although the exact mechanisms are not clear. Overall, very strong or rapid effects are not expected. For milder depression, efficacy is more debatable. Sometimes patients have to try several SSRI preparations until they feel an improvement in symptoms, and some sufferers are not helped by the drugs at all.

      "VERDICT:  1 Unzureichende wissenschaftliche Beweislage\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  High-risk patients can significantly reduce their risk of breast cancer with preventive breast screening. Nevertheless, no general recommendation can be derived from this, as intensive screening programs are an alternative. However, good long-term studies are still lacking for both preventive measures, and the decision can only be made on a very individual basis.\n",

      "VERDICT:  0 Mittlere wissenschaftliche Beweislage | für die Wirksamkeit\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  In contrast to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, where the efficacy of tocilizumab has been well studied, there are only 2 controlled studies for use in children on a specific subtype (systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis) with very few participants. These suggest better efficacy than in adults, but in reality this is likely to be lower than presented in the study results. In addition, the drug can also cause severe side effects.\n",

      "CLAIM:  Does the Toxoplasma gondii parasite affect suicide rates?\n",
      "VERDICT:  0 Niedrige wissenschaftliche Beweislage | für einen Zusammenhang\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  Meanwhile, some studies show a link between infection with the protozoan T. gondii and a higher suicide rate. However, it is not yet clear whether the parasite actually has an influence, because a third factor is also conceivable that influences both the infection rate and the suicide rate.\n",

      "CLAIM:  Is Exemestane better than other hormone-altering drugs for reducing the risk of breast cancer or treating it?\n",
      "VERDICT:  0 Mittlere wissenschaftliche Beweislage | für die bessere Wirksamkeit\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  The group of so-called aromatase inhibitors, which includes Exemestane, causes a higher survival rate in the treatment of breast cancer patients than other hormone-influencing drugs. Exemestane probably does not work any better than the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole. Whether Exemestane works better compared to other aromatase inhibitors is still unclear.\n",

      "EXPLANATION:  Compared to two other birth control pills available in pharmacies, side effects such as acne, weight gain or headaches occur just as often or even more frequently with the newly approved pill. Even if some blood values are somewhat more favorable, it is unclear whether the slightly increased risk of thrombosis generally associated with birth control pills is actually lower with the new preparation.\n",

      "VERDICT:  0 Ja\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  Taking antibiotics can somewhat speed up the healing of an acute sinus infection. However, the success rate is not exhilarating: antibiotics lead to a faster recovery in only 5 out of 100 people. Pain and impairment in everyday life are not improved. And, of course, antibiotics can cause side effects. All in all, antibiotics often don't have much benefit in acute sinusitis.\n",

      "EXPLANATION:  Mesotherapy is an umbrella term for very different treatments that have only the method of administration in common, namely the injection of many small doses of an agent into a specific skin layer. Therefore, it is not possible to make a general statement about its effectiveness. Some studies indicate that it can be a useful way of administering established medications for certain complaints.\n",

      "VERDICT:  2 Niedrige wissenschaftliche Beweislage | für die wirksame Vorbeugung\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  It is possible that sport and exercise, mentally demanding activities, a busy social life and a Mediterranean diet could prevent dementia. It is possible that diabetes, smoking, depression, loneliness, head injuries and pesticides increase the risk of dementia. However, all these factors are not well established.\n",

      "CLAIM:  Can vitamin supplements protect against life-threatening diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular disease?\n",
      "VERDICT:  2 Nein\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  Antioxidant and multivitamin supplements do not reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely from cancer, cardiovascular disease, or other causes. Taking beta-carotene and possibly vitamin E may actually increase the likelihood of premature death. The only exception is vitamin D supplements; they are likely to have a small life-prolonging effect in the elderly.\n",

      "VERDICT:  2 Mittlere wissenschaftliche Beweislage | für die Wirksamkeit von Ernährungumstellung oder Fibraten\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  No. High cholesterol, along with other risk factors, can increase the likelihood of cardiovascular disease. If the proportion of \"bad\" LDL cholesterol in the blood is lowered (with medication or through a change in diet), the risk of diseases such as heart attack or stroke also decreases.\n",

      "CLAIM:  Is combined hormone therapy with estrogen and progestin safe for women in late menopause (after the last menstrual period)?\n",
      "VERDICT:  2 Nein\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  Hormone therapy with estrogen- and progestin-containing preparations makes women more likely to suffer a stroke or heart attack. The risk of breast cancer is also increased. The hormone drugs probably protect a little against diabetes, colon cancer or bone fractures. However, they are no good as a preventive medicine because of the list of side effects. Women who want to relieve their menopausal symptoms with hormone preparations should carefully weigh up the possible benefits and risks with their doctor.\n",

      "EXPLANATION:  In five studies available to date, which tend to be shorter, participants suffered from migraine less frequently with erenumab than with a placebo. The studies were of high methodological quality. In episodic migraine, people \"saved\" about 1 to 2 migraine days per month . For chronic migraine, sufferers had about 2.5 fewer days of pain per month. However, the efficacy and safety data relate to a maximum time frame of six months; the long-term benefit still needs to be explored. The benefit of erenumab compared to other established preventive migraine drugs has also not yet been researched.\n",

      "EXPLANATION:  Whether it is healthier or even beneficial not to wear a bra cannot be answered due to a lack of studies. Conversely, a few studies claim that well-fitting bras could prevent breast pain. However, the studies are methodologically weak and have virtually no validity.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLAIM:  Can oral vein products containing herbal active ingredients such as rutosides, hidrosmin, diosmin, extracts of horse chestnut seed and pine bark, Centella asiatica or grape seed extract or the synthetic substances calcium dobesilate or aminaftone relieve symptoms such as itching, restless or swollen legs, pain and cramps in people suffering from varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency?\n",
      "VERDICT:  0 möglicherweise Ja\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  At present, it is not possible to assess the efficacy of ointments, gels or creams because studies on these products are lacking. The situation is different for vein remedies to be swallowed. Studies suggest that some may improve symptoms of varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency, such as itching, restless or swollen legs, pain and cramps. Quite likely, the remedies are likely to help with water retention in the legs (edema) caused by venous disease. However, better-done, more extensive, and longer-running studies are needed to confidently assess the efficacy of vein remedies for swallowing.\n",

      "VERDICT:  2 Niedrige wissenschaftliche Beweislage | möglicherweise nicht\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  It is likely that dairy products reduce the risk of colon and rectal cancer, and possibly bladder cancer. However, very large amounts of milk & dairy products could possibly increase the risk of prostate cancer. It should be remembered that about the same number of men die from colon and rectal cancer as from prostate cancer. For breast and ovarian cancer and cancer of the endometrium, it is unclear whether cancer risk is affected by milk and dairy products.\n",

      "CLAIM:  Do green tea products provide effective and safe support for weight loss?\n",
      "VERDICT:  2 möglicherweise Nein\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  Due to the number of studies, it is unclear for a number of supposedly appetite-suppressing dietary supplements whether they can support successful weight loss. Well-done studies that run over a long period of time with a sufficient number of test subjects are scarce. Evidence for long-term safety and simultaneous efficacy is therefore lacking.\n",

      "CLAIM:  Can monk's pepper help with cycle disorders?\n",
      "VERDICT:  1 wissenschafliche Beweise fehlen\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLAIM:  Does brisk walking lower mortality? Is some exercise better than none at all?\n",
      "VERDICT:  0 wahrscheinlich Ja\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  Several major studies have consistently concluded that physical activity reduces mortality. Even a brisk walk is enough. More helps more - but in any case, some exercise is much better than none at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLAIM:  Can arthroscopy reduce pain or improve mobility?\n",
      "VERDICT:  2 nein\n",
      "EXPLANATION:  The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.\n",

Dezember 2022', 'explanations': 'Internationale Studien legen nahe, dass die Zahl an Corona-Infektionen sinkt, wenn viele Menschen Masken tragen – egal ob Stoff-, OP- oder FFP2-Masken. Wie groß der Schutzeffekt tatsächlich ist, lässt sich aber nicht genau beziffern. Er hängt vermutlich von der Art der Masken und dem Anteil der Menschen ab, die sie tragen.', 'questions': 'Können Masken die Anzahl an Corona-Infektionen verringern, wenn sie von einem großen Teil der Bevölkerung getragen werden?', 'studies': ' Die Studien im Detail   Welche Studien haben wir berücksichtigt?  Bei unserer Recherche haben wir nur Studien dazu berücksichtigt, die   untersucht haben, wie häufig es unter den Teilnehmenden zu Corona-Infektionen gekommen ist  häufiges Maskentragen mit dem Tragen keiner Maske (oder dem nur seltenen Tragen von Masken) verglichen haben.   Ein US-amerikanisches Forschungsteam hat alle solchen Studien in einer Übersichtsarbeit [1] zusammengefasst.  Am aussagekräftigsten lässt sich das in randomisiert-kontrollierten Studien untersuchen. Darin werden die Teilnehmenden nach dem Zufallsprinzip (Randomisierung) zwei Gruppen zugelost: Eine Gruppe soll Masken tragen, die andere nicht – sie ist die Kontrollgruppe. Am Ende wird verglichen, ob es in der Maskengruppe weniger Infektionen gegeben hat als in der Kontrollgruppe.  Die Durchführung von randomisiert-kontrollierten Studien ist allerdings sehr aufwändig und teuer. Wir haben drei [2,3,5] solcher Studien gefunden.  Auch Beobachtungsstudien haben wir berücksichtigt. Anstatt die Teilnehmenden einer Gruppe zuzuteilen und eine davon zum Maskentragen aufzufordern, beobachtet das wissenschaftliche Studienteam die Teilnehmenden nur. Ob sie Masken tragen oder nicht, haben die Teilnehmenden dabei selbst entschieden. Am Ende vergleicht das Studienteam, ob es unter den Masken-tragenden Personen oder deren Kontaktpersonen weniger Infektionen gibt als unter den nicht-Masken-tragenden.  Solche Beobachtungsstudien sind allerdings weniger aussagekräftig. Bei ihnen kann ein Unterschied in der Infektionsrate auch andere Gründe als das Maskentragen haben. Etwa, dass Masken-tragende Personen sich generell vorsichtiger verhalten. Randomisiert-kontrollierte Studien können solch andere Gründe großteils ausschließen.  Studien zu Masken gegen die Verbreitung des Corona-Virus  Die größte randomisiert-kontrollierte Studie [2] wollte herausfinden, ob verbreitetes Tragen von OP- und Stoffmasken die Anzahl an Infektionen verringern kann. Teilgenommen haben rund 600 Dörfer in Bangladesch mit insgesamt etwa 340.000 Einwohnerinnen und Einwohnern. In dieser Studie wurden aber nicht Personen, sondern ganze Dörfer nach dem Zufallsprinzip einer von zwei Versuchsgruppen zugeteilt. In den Dörfern der einen Gruppe bewarb das Forschungsteam das Maskentragen und teilte kostenlose Masken aus. Die Dörfer der anderen Gruppe bildeten die „Kontrollgruppe“. Dort gab es keine Werbung für das Tragen von Masken. Mitglieder des Forschungsteams zählten den Anteil der maskentragenden Menschen in allen teilnehmenden Dörfern – etwa in Moscheen, Märkten, den Einfahrtsstraßen zu den Dörfern und in Teehäusern. Das taten sie stichprobenartig etwa einmal pro Woche – über einen Zeitraum von 9 Wochen. Die Studie begann im November 2020.  Am Ende verglich das Forschungsteam Maskendörfer und Kontrolldörfer: Wie häufig berichteten die Menschen von typischen Covid-19-Symptomen, beziehungsweise wie viele davon waren nachgewiesenermaßen mit dem Coronavirus infiziert? In den Maskendörfern gab es weniger Infektionen. Dort hatten 7,6 Prozent der Bewohnerinnen und Bewohner Covid-Symptome, in den Kontrolldörfern 8,6 Prozent – ein geringer, aber klarer Unterschied.  Auch zwei Beobachtungsstudien sind dieser Frage nachgegangen. Eine [3] wurde an einem Universitätscampus in den USA durchgeführt. Zwischen Jänner und Mai 2021 wurden dort 265 Studierende positiv auf SARS-CoV-2 getestet. Das Forschungsteam befragte die positiv Getesteten und deren enge Kontaktpersonen, ob sie bei gemeinsamen Treffen Masken getragen hatten. Dabei zeigte sich, dass sich Kontaktpersonen seltener ansteckten, wenn sie und die Infizierte Person beide eine Maske getragen hatten.  Die andere Beobachtungsstudie [4] , durchgeführt im Februar und März 2020 in Peking, hat die Ansteckung mit Covid-19 in 335 Personen aus 124 Familien in Peking untersucht. In jeder Familie gab es mindestens eine Corona-Diagnose, und fast jedes vierte Familienmitglied steckte sich an.  Jene Familien, in denen die erkrankte Person eine Maske trug, konnten weitere Infektionen gut eindämmen, so die Schlussfolgerung des Studienteams. Die Risikoreduktion war dann deutlich, wenn die Infizierten die Maske schon aufhatten, noch bevor sie Symptome zeigten.  Wie aussagekräftig sind diese Studien?  Dass verbreitetes Maskentragen die Ausbreitung des Coronavirus eindämmt, kann die randomisiert-kontrollierte Studie aus Bangladesch [2] am aussagekräftigsten zeigen. Die Aussagekraft ist aber aus folgenden Gründen etwas eingeschränkt:   Der Anteil der maskentragenden Dorfbewohnerinnen und -bewohner konnte nur stichprobenhaft erfasst werden.  Die Zahl der Covid-19-Infizierten ist vermutlich ebenfalls ungenau. Erhoben wurde nämlich hauptsächlich, ob die Teilnehmenden von Covid-Symptomen berichteten. Nur ein Teil von ihnen ließ sich aber auch Blut für einen Antikörpertest abnehmen, um bestätigen zu können, dass sie tatsächlich an Covid-19 erkrankt waren.  Die Werbemaßnahmen in den Maskendörfern hat auch dazu geführt, dass etwas mehr Menschen (29 Prozent) zu anderen Abstand gehalten haben als in den Kontrolldörfern (24 Prozent). Die Masken waren also vermutlich nicht der einzige Grund für die Verringerung der Infektionsrate.  In den Maskendörfern trugen weniger als die Hälfte der Menschen Masken. Es lässt sich nicht sagen, um wie viel die Infektionsrate zurückgegangen wäre, hätten alle oder fast alle Masken getragen. Wir halten es jedoch für plausibel, dass der Effekt dann deutlich größer gewesen wäre.  In den Maskendörfern trugen die Menschen einfache OP- und Stoffmasken . Wie gut im Vergleich dazu die in Europa hauptsächlich verwendeten FFP2-Masken gewirkt hätten, bleibt unklar. Fachleute gehen bei FFP2-Masken von einem weit besseren Schutz aus.   Die beiden Beobachtungsstudien [3,4] können die Ergebnisse der randomisiert-kontrollierten Studie unterstützen. Sie sind aber weniger aussagekräftig als diese.  Studien zu Masken als Selbstschutz  Auch zur Frage des Selbstschutzes fanden wir zwei relativ aussagekräftige randomisiert-kontrollierte Studien.  OP-Masken als Selbstschutz wurden in einer Studie aus Dänemark untersucht. Dafür wurden rund 6000 Personen nach dem Zufallsprinzip (randomisiert) einer von zwei Gruppen zugeteilt: In der Maskengruppe sollten die Teilnehmenden immer eine OP-Maske tragen, wenn sie außer Haus gingen. Die Kontrollgruppe bekam keine solche Empfehlung.  Am Ende erhob das Forschungsteam, wie viele der Teilnehmenden sich innerhalb von einem Monat mit dem Coronavirus infiziert hatten. Einen merklichen Unterschied gab es nicht. Im Laufe eines Monats hatten sich in beiden Gruppen rund 2 Prozent der Teilnehmenden infiziert.  Ein koreanisch-internationales Forschungsteam hat alle Beobachtungsstudien zusammengefasst analysiert, die bis Februar 2021 veröffentlicht wurden [7] . Die Ergebnisse sprechen ebenfalls gegen einen eindeutigen Selbstschutz-Effekt von OP-Masken .  FFP2-Masken als Selbstschutz hat eine randomisiert-kontrollierte Studie mit 1009 Krankenhausangestellten aus Kanada, Israel, Ägypten und Pakistan untersucht. Die Spitalsangestellten hatten regelmäßig mit Covid-Patientinnen und -Patienten zu tun. Per Zufall wurde entschieden, welche Maskenart sie bei ihrer Arbeit tragen sollten: FFP2- oder OP-Masken . 10 Wochen später hatten sich mit beiden Maskenarten ähnlich viele Teilnehmende selbst angesteckt: 10,5 Prozent mit OP-Maske , 9,3% mit FFP2-Maske . Es ist wahrscheinlich, dass der geringe Unterschied nur durch Zufall zustande gekommen ist, anstatt durch die verschiedenen Maskenarten.  Das Forschungsteam hinter der Studie kann mit einiger Wahrscheinlichkeit ausschließen, dass andere Gründe (etwa Impfungen, frühere Covid-Erkrankungen der Teilnehmenden, Infektionen im privaten Haushalt) am fehlenden Unterschied schuld sind.  Ob eine FFP2-Maske die Trägerin oder den Träger besser schützt als gar keine Maske, hat die Studie allerdings nicht untersucht.  Einen Selbstschutz-Vergleich von Personen ohne Masken und solchen mit FFP2-Masken haben nur weniger aussagekräftige Beobachtungsstudien gemacht. Sie kommen zu widersprüchlichen Ergebnissen [1,7] .  Wie aussagekräftig sind diese Studien?  Die beiden randomisiert-kontrollierten Studien [5,6] sind relativ aussagekräftig. Allerdings ist die Verlässlichkeit ihrer Ergebnisse geringfügig eingeschränkt:   Die Anzahl an Covid-19-Fällen ist zu gering für ein wirklich aussagekräftiges Ergebnis. In der dänischen Studie zu OP-Masken [6] erkrankten von den rund 6000 Teilnehmenden nur 95 an Covid-19. In der Studie zu FFP2-Masken [5] mit internationalem Krankenhauspersonal waren es 99 Erkrankungen.  In der Studie zu OP-Masken  [6] lässt sich nicht ausschließen, dass die Teilnehmenden der Maskengruppe sich durch das Maskentragen sicherer gefühlt haben und daher weniger auf Abstandhalten und Hygienemaßnahmen geachtet haben. Das könnte dazu geführt haben, dass die Wirksamkeit der Masken unterschätzt wurde.  In der Studie zu FFP2-Masken  [5] durften die Teilnehmenden mit OP-Maske wenn nötig auch eine FFP2-Maske tragen.  In der Studie zu OP-Masken  [6] wusste das Forschungsteam bei der Datenauswertung wer Masken getragen hatte und wer nicht. In beiden Studien war den Teilnehmenden bewusst, ob sie eine OP-Maske (oder FFP2-Maske) trugen. Daher könnten die Erwartungen des Forschungsteams und der Teilnehmenden die Ergebnisse verzerrt haben.   Bei den Beobachtungsstudien zum Selbstschutz ist das Problem dasselbe wie bei denen zum Fremdschutz: Das Infektionsrisiko könnte auch durch andere Faktoren als das Maskentragen beeinflusst worden sein. Zudem ergibt die zusammenfassende Analyse des koreanisch-internationalen Forschungsteams [7] eine große Schwankungsbreite für die Ergebnisse. Ein geringer Selbstschutz lässt sich somit nicht ausschließen.  Hat das Tragen von Masken negative Auswirkungen?  Zu negativen Auswirkungen des Maskentragens haben wir zwei systematische Übersichtsarbeiten [8,9] gefunden, die die Studienlage bis zum Frühjahr 2020 zusammengefasst haben. Nur vier randomisiert-kontrollierte Studien haben solch negative Effekte erhoben – sie liefern aber keine genauen Zahlen. Auch die Studie zu FFP2-Masken [5] hat negative Auswirkungen untersucht. Wie häufig die Nebenwirkungen sind, und ab welcher Tragedauer sie auftreten, lässt sich aber nicht mit Sicherheit sagen.    ', 'text': ' Dieser Beitrag ist Teil unserer Faktencheck-Serie Mythen und Fakten zum Coronavirus  In Teilen Asiens war es schon vor der Corona-Pandemie gang und gäbe: das Tragen von Masken im Alltag. Die Barriere im Gesicht soll verhindern, dass sich ansteckende Krankheiten ausbreiten. Durch die Pandemie sind Masken auch den Menschen in Europa vertraut.  Hintergrund ist, dass Corona-Infizierte beim Husten, Niesen oder Sprechen Virus-haltige Tröpfchen ausstoßen. Auch die ausgeatmete Luft von Infizierten enthält einen Nebel aus feinsten Speicheltröpfchen (Aerosole), in denen das Virus sitzt. Atmet eine andere Person die Tröpfchen in ausreichender Menge ein, kann sie sich mit dem Coronavirus anstecken. Das Problem ist, dass Infizierte zu Beginn noch gar nicht wissen, dass sie sich angesteckt haben. Manche Menschen infizieren sich auch völlig symptomlos – sie bekommen also selbst gar keine Krankheitssymptome. Auch wenn sie (noch) nicht krank sind, können sie das SARS-CoV-2-Virus jedoch an andere weitergeben.  Anfangs umstritten  Zu Beginn der Pandemie waren sich Forschende unklar darüber, ob und wie gut Masken vor einer Infektion mit SARS-CoV-2 schützen. In der Bevölkerung zweifeln manche nach wie vor an der Sinnhaftigkeit des Maskentragens. In etlichen Ländern – etwa im Norden Europas – gab es nie eine Maskenpflicht. In anderen Ländern waren oder sind die Gesetze dazu deutlich strenger. So gilt mit Stand Dezember 2022 in Österreich und Deutschland teilweise noch immer eine Pflicht zum Tragen von FFP2-Masken in öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln.  Seit Beginn der Corona-Pandemie wurden drei Arten von Masken verwendet:   Medizinische OP-Masken (wie sie Ärztinnen und Ärzte bei Operationen tragen) sollen Menschen in der Umgebung vor Tröpfchen durch Sprechen, Husten oder Niesen schützen.  Von Stoff-Masken erhofft man sich einen ähnlichen Effekt  FFP2-Masken filtern von all diesen Maskenarten am besten. Sie filtern die eingeatmete Luft genauso wie die ausgeatmete.   Wir wollten wissen, wie gut das Tragen von Masken die Verbreitung von Covid-19 bremst. Indem wir alle bisherigen Studien dazu durchforstet haben, haben wir versucht, Antworten auf folgende Fragen finden:   Wie gut verhindern Masken, dass sich das Virus weiterverbreiten kann?  Wie gut können sich Gesunde mit Masken vor einer Ansteckung schützen?    Studien zeigen gebremste Ausbreitung  Nach drei Jahren Pandemie gibt es mittlerweile relativ aussagekräftige Daten dazu, dass Masken die Ausbreitung des Corona-Virus bremsen können. Ein US-amerikanisches Forschungsteam hat sie in einer Übersichtsarbeit [1] zusammengefasst.  An der größten und verlässlichsten dieser Studien waren rund 340.000 Menschen aus knapp 600 Dörfern in Bangladesch beteiligt [2] . In der Hälfte der Dörfer wurde das Tragen von Masken beworben und die Bewohnerinnen und Bewohner bekamen kostenlos OP- und Stoff-Masken ausgeteilt. Das führte dazu, dass immerhin 42 Prozent der Menschen Masken trugen. In den restlichen Dörfern gab es keine Maskenempfehlung, sie dienten als Vergleichsgruppe. Dort trugen nur 13 Prozent eine Maske.  Das Ergebnis: In den Masken-Dörfern erkrankten weniger Menschen als in den Vergleichsdörfern. Der Unterschied war im Zeitraum von 9 Wochen allerdings nicht groß:   42 Prozent trugen Masken: 7,6 Prozent der Dorfbevölkerung erkrankten  13 Prozent trugen Masken: 8,6 Prozent der Dorfbevölkerung erkrankten   Die Masken dürften die Erkrankungswahrscheinlichkeit also prinzipiell verringern – sogar wenn weniger als die Hälfte der Bevölkerung Masken trägt. Es erscheint plausibel, dass der Effekt umso größer ist, je mehr Menschen sich daran halten. Wie groß der Schutzeffekt ist, wenn (fast) die gesamte Bevölkerung Masken trägt, kann die Studie jedoch nicht beantworten.  OP-Masken schienen die Weiterverbreitung in der Studie ähnlich gut zu bremsen wie Stoff-Masken. Fachleute gehen davon aus, dass der Effekt mit FFP2-Masken noch höher gewesen wäre.  Zwei weitere Studien [3,4] bekräftigen die Wirksamkeit von Masken – auch wenn ihre Aussagekraft geringer ist. In einer Studie wurden Studierende an einem Universitätscampus in den USA beobachtet, in der anderen [4] die Ansteckungshäufigkeit in chinesischen Haushalten, in denen ein Familienmitglied infiziert war. Trugen alle Beteiligten – inklusive der infizierten Person – Masken, war die Ansteckungsgefahr in beiden Studien deutlich erniedrigt. Welche Art von Masken die Teilnehmenden verwendeten, ist jedoch in beiden Studien unklar.  Selbstschutz: kein großer Effekt zu erwarten  Wenn viele Menschen in der Bevölkerung Maske tragen, dürfte das Virus also weniger leicht von Mensch zu Mensch wandern – aber schützt die Maske die Trägerin oder den Träger vor einer Infektion? Bisherige Forschungsergebnisse zu einem solchen Selbstschutz-Effekt sind enttäuschend.  Ob man sich mit FFP2-Maske besser vor einer Infektion schützt als ohne Maske, haben nur Beobachtungsstudien mit geringer Aussagekraft untersucht. Sie kommen zu widersprüchlichen Ergebnissen [1] .  Im Vergleich zu einer OP-Maske dürfte eine FFP2-Maske die tragende Person jedenfalls nicht wesentlich besser schützen. Das legt eine einigermaßen aussagekräftige Studie [5] mit Krankenhauspersonal nahe, das sich regelmäßig um Covid-Patientinnen und -Patienten kümmerte.  OP-Masken wiederum scheinen das Risiko so gut wie nicht zu senken, sich selbst mit dem Coronavirus anzustecken. Darauf deuten die Ergebnisse einer relativ aussagekräftigen Studie [6] aus Dänemark hin. Darin trugen die Hälfte der rund 6000 Teilnehmende OP-Masken, sobald sie das Haus verließen, die andere Hälfte hingegen nicht. Im Laufe eines Monats zeigte sich kein wirklicher Unterschied, in beiden Gruppen gab es ähnlich viele Infektionen. Ob Infizierte durch das Tragen einer Maske auch andere schützen können, hat die Studie nicht untersucht.  Ein Selbstschutz-Effekt durch FFP2-Masken ist den Ergebnissen zufolge zwar nicht ausgeschlossen – hoch ist er aber vermutlich nicht.  Negative Begleiterscheinungen?  Neben den Vorteilen haben Masken auch unerwünschte Auswirkungen. Viele Teilnehmende etwa empfinden das Atmen mit Maske etwas anstrengender – mit FFP2-Maske haben das in einer Studie etwa 20 Prozent des teilnehmenden Krankenhauspersonals angegeben, mit OP-Maske rund 10 Prozent [8] . Bisherige Studien deuten jedoch darauf hin, dass man auch mit Maske ausreichend Sauerstoff bekommt. Wir haben dazu einen eigenen Beitrag veröffentlicht.  Von Kopfschmerzen berichteten die Teilnehmenden in dieser Studie [8] und einer anderen [5] etwas häufiger, wenn sie FFP2-Masken trugen (7 bzw. 13 Prozent) als wenn sie eine OP-Maske aufhatten (4 bzw. 5 Prozent).  In einigen Studien berichtete das teilnehmende Spitalspersonal auch von Hautreizungen durch das stundenlange Tragen der Masken [9] – auch wenn sich dabei FFP2-Masken möglicherweise nicht von OP-Masken unterscheiden [5] .

Die langfristigen Folgen der „Zuckerkrankheit“ sind nicht nur regelmäßige Einnahme von Medikamenten bis hin zu Insulinspritzen, Diabetes kann über die Jahre die Gesundheit des ganzen Körpers in Mitleidenschaft ziehen. Eine der gravierenderen Folgen sind Augenschädigungen, die über lange Zeit hin sogar zur Erblindung führen können. Diabetes verursacht Netzhautschädigungen Etwa 6 von 100 Österreichern leiden an der Zuckerkrankheit, wobei die Häufigkeit mit dem Alter stark ansteigt. Der überwiegende Teil (5 von 100 Einwohnern) leiden an Diabetes vom Typ 2 (früher auch Alters-Diabetes genannt), welcher praktisch immer Lebensstil-bedingt ist und in den allermeisten Fällen mit Übergewicht, einseitiger Ernährung und Bewegungsmangel einhergeht [ 4 ]. Zu den Langzeitfolgen von Diabetes zählen nicht nur ein erhöhtes Herzinfarkt- oder Schlaganfallrisiko, Nieren- und Nervenschädigungen sowie schlecht heilende Geschwüre, auch die Augen sind oft betroffen. Die hohen Blutzuckerwerte schädigen unter anderem die Wände der feinen Blutgefäße in der Netzhaut des Auges, es kommt zum Aussickern von Flüssigkeit sowie zu Eiweiß-Ablagerungen. Neben Flüssigkeitsansammlungen (Ödemen) können sich in einem fortgeschrittenem Stadium schließlich neue, krankhafte Blutgefäße bilden, die allerdings brüchig sind und Blutungen im Inneren des Augapfels auslösen können. Etwa ein Viertel aller Diabetiker hat zumindest eine Form dieser als Diabetische Retinopathie bezeichneten Netzhauterkrankung, das Risiko dafür steigt mit der Dauer des Diabetes an. Betreffen die Flüssigkeitsansammlungen die Stelle des schärfsten Sehens auf der Netzhaut (Makula), sprechen Ärzte vom sogenannten Makula-Ödem. Ein schweres Makula-Ödem tritt bei etwa 2 bis 10 unter 100 Diabetikern auf und kann zu teilweisen Sehausfällen bis hin zur Erblindung führen [ 3 ]. Früherkennung: Optische Kohärenztomographie unzuverlässig Die meisten Diabetes-Patienten mit solchen krankhaften Netzhaut-Schädigungen bemerken erst lange nach Beginn Symptome wie dunkle Flecken im Gesichtsfeld oder eine Beeinträchtigung des scharfen Sehens. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt ist eine effektive Behandlung allerdings nur mehr sehr eingeschränkt möglich, daher verbessert eine frühzeitige Erkennung die Behandlungschancen stark [ 3 ]. Die Oberösterreichischen Nachrichten vermitteln den Eindruck, dass die Methode der Optischen Kohärenztomographie (einer dreidimensionalen Computer-Darstellung der Netzhaut mittels Laser-Technik) die Chancen auf Früherkennung eines klinisch signifikanten Makula-Ödems stark erhöht. Eine Zusammenfassung von klinischen Studien in einer systematischen Übersichtsarbeit der Cochrane-Collaboration zeigt jedoch, dass die Genauigkeit dieser relativ teuren Methode sehr zu wünschen übrig lässt [ 1 ]. Wenn 1000 Diabetikern mit Retinopathien (von denen 500 klinisch signifikante Makula-Ödeme haben) nur mittels Kohärenstomographie untersucht werden, würden diese bei etwa 105 Patienten übersehen werden. Auf der anderen Seite würde die Methode bei 75 Patienten ohne Erkrankung zu einer unnötigen Laser-Behandlung führen. Eine regelmäßige Vorsorgeuntersuchung zur Vermeidung von Folgeschäden ist in jedem Fall sinnvoll, dennoch spricht nichts gegen die Verwendung der bisher üblichen Methoden: Bei der Ophtalmoskopie sieht der Arzt mithilfe eines eigenen Geräts direkt ins Augeninnere, nachdem die Pupillen durch spezielle Augentropfen erweitert wurden und so die Untersuchung erleichtert wird. Der Arzt kann den Zustand des Augeninneren auch anhand einer sogenannten Fundus-Fotografie beurteilen, für die keine Pupillenerweiterung notwendig ist. Spritzenbehandlung wirksam, aber unzureichend untersucht Die Standardbehandlung von diabetischen Makula-Ödemen ist die sogenannte Photocoagulation, dabei werden mit Laser undichte und krankhaft veränderte Blutgefäße versiegelt oder zerstört [ 4 ]. Diese Behandlung senkt das Risiko für ein Fortschreiten der Sehverschlechterung deutlich, führt aber zu keiner Besserung der Sehkraft. Die Laserbehandlung ist allerdings nicht ohne Risiko, in manchen Fällen kann es dadurch auch zu einer unerwünschten Verringerung der Sehstärke oder anderen Nebenwirkungen kommen, die die Sehkraft beeinträchtigen. Ist Blut aus defekten Gefäßen ins Augeninnere ausgetreten, kann der Arzt dieses auch operativ entfernen und so eine Besserung hervorrufen. In wenigen Fällen kann diese Operation aber auch Komplikationen wie etwa eine Netzhautablösung hervorrufen. Injektionen in den Glaskörper des Augapfels – bei lokaler Betäubung – können ebenfalls hilfreich sein. Spritzen mit Steroidhormonen können hier kurzfristig helfen, auf lange Sicht ist diese Behandlung jedoch nicht vielversprechend, zudem auch mit Nebenwirkungen gerechnet werden muss. Die in den Oberösterreichischen Nachrichten ausführlich erwähnte regelmäßige Injektion von sogenannten VEGF-Hemmer-Substanzen kann das unkontrollierte Wachsen neuer Blutgefäße verhindern und sogar zu einer teilweisen Verbesserung der Sehkraftverlusts führen [ 2 ]. Die injizierten Substanzen sind aber nicht nur sehr teuer, ihre Langzeit-Wirksamkeit und -Sicherheit ist noch wenig untersucht, wie eine weitere systematische Übersichtsarbeit der Cochrane-Collaboration zeigt [ 2 ]. Eine häufig erwähnte Nebenwirkung der VEGF-Hemmer-Injektionen war ein Ansteigen des Augeninnendrucks, ein Zustand der eventuell zu Komplikationen führen kann. Auch zu einer Trübung der Linse oder Entzündungen des Augeninneren kann es mitunter kommen. Fazit: übertriebene Darstellung neuer Behandlungsmethoden Regelmäßige Vorsorgeuntersuchungen (Screening) durch den Augenarzt sind bei Personen mit Diabetes sinnvoll, da Retinopathien oder gar Makula-Ödeme oft erst sehr spät bemerkt werden und eine effektive Behandlung zu diesem Zeitpunkt nur mehr bedingt möglich ist. Die von den Oberösterreichischen Nachrichten beschriebene Optische Kohärenztomographie ist als Diagnosemethode für diesen Zweck allerdings ungeeignet, dafür ist sie eindeutig zu ungenau. Auch die Darstellung der Wirksamkeit von VEGF-Hemmer-Injektionen als neue Behandlungsmethode ist klar übertrieben und voreingenommen – über Risiken und Unsicherheiten informiert der Zeitungsartikel nicht.
